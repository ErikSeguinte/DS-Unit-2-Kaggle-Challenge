Scikit-learn doesn't support this, but some tree algorithm implementations do. For example, [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/), or R's [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) package.\n","- **Numeric Encoding:** Synonymous with Label Encoding, or \"Ordinal\" Encoding with random order. We can use [category_encoders.OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/ordinal.html).\n","- **One-Hot Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.OneHotEncoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/onehot.html).\n","- **Binary Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.BinaryEncoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/binary.html).\n","\n","\n","**2.** The short video \n","**[Coursera — How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers — Concept of mean encoding](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/competitive-data-science/concept-of-mean-encoding-b5Gxv)** introduces an interesting idea: use both X _and_ y to encode categoricals.\n","\n","Category Encoders has multiple implementations of this general concept:\n","\n","- [CatBoost Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/catboost.html)\n","- [James-Stein Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/jamesstein.html)\n","- [Leave One Out](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/leaveoneout.html)\n","- [M-estimate](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/mestimate.html)\n","- [Target Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/targetencoder.html)\n","- [Weight of Evidence](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/woe.html)\n","\n","Category Encoder's mean encoding implementations work for regression problems or binary classification problems. \n","\n","For multi-class classification problems, you will need to temporarily reformulate it as binary classification. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(min_samples_leaf=..., smoothing=...) # Both parameters > 1 to avoid overfitting\n","X_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_train, y_train=='functional')\n","X_val_encoded = encoder.transform(X_train, y_val=='functional')\n","```\n","\n","For this reason, mean encoding won't work well within pipelines for multi-class classification problems.\n","\n","**3.** The **[dirty_cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)** library has a Target Encoder implementation that works with multi-class classification.\n","\n","```python\n"," dirty_cat.TargetEncoder(clf_type='multiclass-clf')\n","```\n","It also implements an interesting idea called [\"Similarity Encoder\" for dirty categories](https://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/machine-learning-on-non-curated-data-154905090).\n","\n","However, it seems like dirty_cat doesn't handle missing values or unknown categories as well as category_encoders does. And you may need to use it with one column at a time, instead of with your whole dataframe.\n","\n","**4. [Embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/embeddings)** can work well with sparse / high cardinality categoricals.\n","\n","_**I hope it’s not too frustrating or confusing that there’s not one “canonical” way to encode categoricals. It’s an active area of research and experimentation! Maybe you can make your own contributions!**_"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Setup\n","\n","You can work locally (follow the [local setup instructions](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2/local/)) or on Colab (run the code cell below)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"o9eSnDYhUGD7"},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","import sys\n","\n","# If you're on Colab:\n","if 'google.colab' in sys.modules:\n","    DATA_PATH = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdaSchool/DS-Unit-2-Kaggle-Challenge/master/data/'\n","    !pip install category_encoders==2.*\n","\n","# If you're working locally:\n","else:\n","    DATA_PATH = '../data/'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"QJBD4ruICm1m"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"((59400, 41), (14358, 40))"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","train = pd.merge(pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH+'waterpumps/train_features.csv'), \n","                 pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH+'waterpumps/train_labels.csv'))\n","test = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH+'waterpumps/test_features.csv')\n","sample_submission = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH+'waterpumps/sample_submission.csv')\n","\n","train.shape, test.shape"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Section 1\n","- [ ] Define a function to wrangle train, validate, and test sets in the same way.
